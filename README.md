# VR electrical lab
Develop electrical circuits and understand how current flows through electrons and its effect on various components in virtual reality.
Note: We have used the Oculus Rift HMD for our testing, and the below steps are in accordance with its controls. 

## Steps to make a circuit:
1. Start the project using Unity hub on your system. Connect the HMD to the system.
2. Start the simulation by clicking on the play button at the top of the screen. Wear the HMD.
3. Use the left thumbstick to perform translational motion and the right thumbstick to perform rotation at your current location. Use these controls to reach from your current position to the location of the main table under the help chart, in front of you.
4. The table is a 9 x 9 array of 'pegs'. There are 3 components on the left of the table, viz. switch, battery, wire, and 3 components on the right of the table, viz. bulbs of resistances 1000, 2000 and 5000 ohms. To make the circuit, choose a component from the side of the table. Reach out to it and pick it up. Notice that a new copy of the component spawns in its place.
5. Take the component to the table and bring it close to two adjacent pegs on the table, the component oriented either horizontally or vertically. Release the component and it will get attached onto the table.
6. Complete a closed circuit of your choice in this manner, ensuring that it is a realistic circuit. If it is, the circuit will work and any bulbs in the circuit through which non-zero current is passing will glow with some intensity.
7. To observe the various measurements of the circuit (voltage, current flowing in various branches, resistances), pull down the left side of the lever at the bottom of the table.
8. To reset the table, pull down the right side of the lever, and the components will fall back to their original positions by the side of the table.
